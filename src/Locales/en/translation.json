  "bioDescription": "I'm 28 years old, I'm from Santa Rosa - RS, and I've lived in Portugal since 2016./n I started my research career as a scientific initiation scholarship holder at the Research Group on Acoustics and Vibrations (GPAV) at UFSM in the project “Experimental characterization and of new sound-absorbing materials”./n In 2016, I completed the undergraduate internship at dBwave.i - Acoustica e Vib Vibrations, based in Lisbon.",
  "bioDescriptionMore": "Still in the second semester of 2016, right after graduating in Acoustic Engineering, I started my PhD in Civil Engineering at the University of Coimbra, which is the thesis entitled “Study of the sound absorption of granular materials and hybrid systems with resonant structures” that was completed and approved with Distinction and Praise on 07/31/2020./n During my PhD, I was a research fellow at the Institute for Sustainability and Innovation in Structural Engineering (ISISE) in the project Development of meta & smart-materials./n I participated twice during the doctorate of short-term scientific missions financed by Cost European Cooperation in Science & Technology under the project Designs for Noise Reducing Materials and Structures (DENORMS), both carried out at the University of Alicante, Spain, and entitled respectively “Experimental evaluation and incorporation in equivalent fluid models of macroscopic parameters characterizing granular materials for noise control” and “Metaporous Concrete”.",
